## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt that when I come across an issue and I think I'm doing exactly what I've seen someone else do as a solution to the same problem. I should pause and proofread my code carefully for errors.

### Continued development

Use vendor prefixes to ensure styles are the same across many browsers.
Test the solution using a screenreader, keyboard only, prefers reduced motion.
use prettier to format the code

Google page speed insights (Lighthouse tab in chrome devtools):

- used `<meta name="description" content="description of page">` tag for SEO
