# Outline of what I need for this project

I will need to use forms with a custom styled radio button.
The label for the radio button must be inside the circle.

Flexbox for the main layout as it's not so complex.

I will use JavaScript to store the option the user chose and then display that on the thank you page.
I should also have JS handle the switching of the visible page.
For this project I will create a `<main></main>` (this will be the container for the different secions.)
Then I will store the rating and thank you states in separate `<section></section>` inside the main tag.
Using javascript I will switch the display property of the items from flex to none.

I should set rating 5 on autofocus...

It will be centered using cssgrid, 3 rows.
The attribution will be placed at the bottom of the screen
